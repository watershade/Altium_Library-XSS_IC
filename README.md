## About this project
I have make many altium designer project in recently years. And I collects many componts and make a Integrated library for them at the same time. Some of them are low-quality. Some of them move from Ultralibrarian or other tools or websites. But lots of them are made by myself.
MyICs is large and it have many components. But it is mussy. So I want to tidy it and publish them to persons who need them.
Altium_XSS_IC_Libs have many ICs. And it is the largest part of MyICs Library.

And I will create more componts(ICs) for this new library. MyICs will not update but will keep it for my old project. MyICs will not publish.

## Initial Commit
It is the old MyICs. And I haven't tide it.

## Version 0.1
I will move connectors/headers out of initial commit and collects them to XSS_Connect library.
